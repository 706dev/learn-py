# Data Types
In programming we have something called data types. Data types are the categorization of data in our program. I know that's one heck of a sentence. Basically when we want the computer to rememebr something, it should know what category to put that data in.

## String
A string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Strings are surrounded by double or single quotes.

### Examples
`"Strings can be surrounded by double quotes"` <br/>
`'Or single quotes!'`<br/>

## Integer
An integer is a whole number. 

### Examples
1, 2, 3, 400

## Float
A float is a decimal!

### Examples
1.5, 6.7

## Boolean
A boolean is simply just true or false. The first level is capitalized!

### Examples
`True`<br/>
`False`

## List
As the name suggest, a list is a list of items. Surrounded by square brackets `[]`. A list can hold any other data type.

### Examples
`['Psuedo', 15, 4.20, True]`

## Tuple
A tuple is a collection of items. Tuples are ordered and mutable. They can have duplicates. Surrounded by parenthesis `()`.

### Examples
`('python', 10, False)`

## Set
A set is another collection of items. Sets are unordered, immutable and can't have duplicates. Surrounded by curly braces `{}`.

### Examples
`{'Psuedo', 'James', 12.5}`

## Dictionary
A dictionary is another collection of data types. Surrounded by curly braces `{}`. It is special because it stores data like a dictionary would! Key, value pairs. What good would the Webster Dictionary be if it only had a list of words? Not very.

### Examples
`{'python': 'the best programming language', 'age': 30}`

## NoneType
NoneType is emptiness. It's a representation of nothing or an unknown value.

### Examples
`None`
