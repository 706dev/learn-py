# Day 1 - A New Beginning
So you've decided to start a path to being a developer. Cool.

# General Beginning
## Why do we program?
Think of programming as us speaking a native language to the computer. English probably isn't the best choice for giving the instructions to a machine. Do you think it could interpret sarcasm? Definitely! (sarcasm)

So we are just telling the computer what to do, in a language it can understand.

## What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, OOP (object oriented programming) language. A language that we can speak to computers in. Hope you've been working on your Parseltongue.

## What is PEP8?
It's pretty early to be talking about this, so don't get hung up. PEP8 is a style guide for writing code in Python. Basically, in English we are taught to write titles like "Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone". Imagine if you picked up a book and the title was, "harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone". That would look weird, right? So PEP8 tells us how we should style our code to make it easily readable for the next.
